# local kernel weighted conditional likelihood estimation 
Two-piece distribution based  semiparametric quantile regression is proposed. All the three parameters (location, scale, index) are assumed to be unknown but smooth functions of a covariate. A kernel polynomial weighted local likelihood approach is used to estimate the unknown smooth parameters functions. Finally, the $\uptau$th conditional quantile of the survival time is estimated in a plug-in approach.
